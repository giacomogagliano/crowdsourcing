Building a crouwdsourcing contrat.

This is my first attempt building a contract =P. I never coded in my life, so manager your expectations =).
I compiled this contract on solidity and it gives me some warning that I would love to learn to solve!

I actually have no idea how GitHub works, maybe I have to post this somewhere!

I also would love to learn how to create an interface for this contract.
